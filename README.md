#AlamoVsSession

This project explores the differences between using Alamofire and URLSession.

The top three buttons use Alamofire.
One each for GET, POST and DELETE.
The results can be seen printed to the console.

The bottom three buttons use URLSession.
Again, one for each type with the results in the console.

The api endpoint used comes from here: http://jsonplaceholder.com
It's a good site to mock get, post and even delete sample data.

Be sure to open the workspace and not the project.

#AlamoPhotoTagger

This project uses Alamofire to upload a photo to the internet to the Imagga site for analysis.
Imagga is an amazing Image Recognition Platform which will view the photo and report the tags and colors identified.
